## Project Description
Sound-Board is an Android application designed as a soundboard. The interface consists of five buttons, each paired with a combo box that allows users to select from a list of predetermined sounds. Users can assign sounds to the buttons and save these configurations as soundbanks, which can be selected from a dropdown menu.

## Features
- 5 buttons for playing sounds
- 5 combo boxes for selecting and assigning sounds to buttons
- Dropdown menu for selecting stored soundbanks
- User-friendly interface with portrait and landscape modes

## API
We are using the [Freesound API](https://freesound.org/docs/api/) for this project. With the Freesound API, you can browse, search, and retrieve information about Freesound users, packs, and the sounds themselves. You can find similar sounds to a given target (based on content analysis) and retrieve automatically extracted features from audio files, as well as perform advanced queries combining content analysis features and other metadata (tags, etc.). With the Freesound API, you can also upload, comment, rate, and bookmark sounds!

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/lollisjosh/Sound-Board.git
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage
1. Launch the Sound-Board application.
2. Use the combo boxes to select sounds for each button.
3. Press the buttons to play the assigned sounds.
4. Save your sound configurations as soundbanks for future use.
5. Select stored soundbanks from the dropdown menu to quickly load pre-assigned sound configurations.
